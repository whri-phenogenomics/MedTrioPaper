# *CYP2C19* Poor Metaboliser Enrichment with Cross-Generation Early Amitriptyline Discontinuation

This repository contains scripts and resources used for the analysis described in the paper:  
**“*CYP2C19* poor metaboliser enrichment with cross-generation early amitriptyline discontinuation: a proof-of-concept study for integration of family health history and pharmacogenomics.”**

## Background

Genetics play a critical role in medication response, yet the integration of family health history (FHH) with pharmacogenomics has been underexplored. This study utilizes electronic health records to assess cross-generational patterns in medication exposure and examines the utility of FHH in pharmacogenomic studies. 

**Key Findings:**  
- Offspring with a two-generation history of early amitriptyline discontinuation are significantly enriched for *CYP2C19* poor metaboliser variants.  
- These results highlight the potential for FHH to guide pharmacogenomic testing in clinical settings.
